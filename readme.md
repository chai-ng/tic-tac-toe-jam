# ❌⭕️ Tic Tac Toe Jam! ❌⭕️

## Introduction

Access the game here: [Chai's tic tac toe](https://chai-ng.github.io/tic-tac-toe-jam/)

## Approach taken

I wanted to re-invent the classic tic-tac-toe game, and add in a few cool new features such as:
* playing against a computer
* position suggestions

### Project approach
1. Setup _Trello project board_ to outline key tasks and requirements, prioritise them and have a home for my fun ideas

2. Get inspired by other tic tac toe games out there and put the fun ideas on my backlog

3. Wireframe out the flow of the game on _Figma_, including the fun features and carve out what is the 'MVP' equivalent

4. Build the barebones logic and elements on the game, and style the bare minimum so that it's at least lookable

5. Don't hold back - start building out those fun features!
